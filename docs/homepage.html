        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>At Xyber, your privacy and security are our top priorities. This policy outlines how we handle your data and how our app helps protect you from common cyber threats.</p>
        
        <h3>1. Data Access and Collection:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Xyber does not collect or store your phone number, message content, or any personally identifiable information (PII).</li>
            <li>We access your messages only to scan for links within them. This ensures we can protect you in real-time from malicious or unsafe links.</li>
            <li>No message contents are stored or transmitted outside of your device.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>2. How We Protect You:</h3>
        <p>Threat actors/attackers and scammers attempt to target you using four primary methods:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>SMS: Attackers may send phishing or malicious links in SMS messages that attempt to steal your personal information or install harmful software on your device.</li>
            <li>Phone Calls: Scammers may use phone calls to trick you into providing sensitive information or direct you to malicious websites or applications.</li>
            <li>Emails: Emails are often used to deliver phishing links, malicious attachments, or social engineering attacks aimed at stealing your passwords, financial details, or infecting your device.</li>
            <li>Files: Attackers may send files with embedded payloads or unsafe code that could harm your device or steal your data once opened.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>That's why Xyber rises up with the responsibility on shoulder to protect billions of innocent people like you from Threat Actors and Scammers. Behind the scene, the developer is constantly chasing them, hunting them, fighting face to face round the clock - all this to protect you all! That way, you fight with the app while the developer fights in the dark! Let's do it!</p>
        
        <p>Xyber's technology detects links within your messages but does not read or store the contents of your messages themselves, as they are sensitive. No humans are involved in the detection process, ensuring your privacy remains intact.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Permissions:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Xyber requires access to certain device permissions (such as SMS and email) to detect links and files in messages. These permissions are used only for real-time protection and threat detection.</li>
            <li>You have full control over these permissions and can manage or revoke them via your device settings. Disabling permissions may limit the appâ€™s ability to protect you.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>4. Data Privacy:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>All threat detection and analysis happen locally on your device. No data, messages, or links are sent to our servers or shared with third parties.</li>
            <li>Your personal data remains completely private and secure on your device.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>5. Changes to the Policy:</h3>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect improvements or legal changes. Any updates will be available here, and we encourage you to review this policy regularly.</p>
        
        <p>By using Xyber, you agree to this Privacy Policy. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:support@xyber.app">support@xyber.app</a>.</p>
